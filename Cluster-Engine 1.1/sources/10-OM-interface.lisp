-fwd-indep: Forward is independant from backtracking.
This rule does not condsider how the engines backtracked when stepping 
forward in the search. 

-fwd-rule2: If the system backtracked earlier, the system will step forward 
these engines (in reverse order) before picking any other engine.
Backjumping is not taken into consideration when stepping forward (if several 
steps where backjumped, only one forward step will be forced).

-fwd-rule3: Index plays a role in forward stepping. If an engine 
backtracked, it will be forced to step forward by this rule (like 
fwd-rule2), however if the index for this engine when forwarding it is 
lower than when it was backtracked, it will not be forced to step 
forward until the system reaches the correct index. Instead the system 
will step forward according to the general priorities (below).

-fwd-rule4: Index plays a role in forward stepping. As fwd-rule3 but instead 
of leting the system use general rules if index is lower than at the moment 
of backtracking, the engine that needs to catch up will be forced to catch up.

-fwd-rule5: Count value plays a role in forward stepping. If an engine was 
backtracked, it will be forced to step forward by this rule (like fwd-rule2). 
However if the count value for this engine when forwarding it is lower than 
when it was backtracked, the general rules (see below) will determine how to 
step forward until the system reaches the correct count value for this engine.

-fwd-rule6: Rhythm and metric engines are stepped forward acording to
time points, pitch engines are stepped forward accoriding to ount value: If an 
engine was backtracked, it will be forced to step forward by this rule (like 
fwd-rule2). However if the time point/count value for this engine when forwarding 
it is lower than when it was backtracked, it will be stepped forward without 
deducting it from the backtrak route. If the point/vaule is higher than when
it was backtracked, the rule will skip and go to next step in the backtrack
history.

-fwd-rule6B: As fwd-rule6, but if the time point/count value for this engine 
when forwarding it is lower than when it was backtracked, it will be stepped
forward accoring to general rules. 

If backtracking does not play a role, the system will decide what engine to 
forward according to these three priorities: 
1. Metric structure has to be longest.
2. Fill out pitches (for durations without pitches) in all voices - start 
with the voice with highest priority.
3. Search for rhythm in the voice that is most behind. If two or more are 
equal, the default search order determines which voice to search next.

 	<alt-beatlength> allows the user to define another beat length than the time 
 	signature indicates. This will affect rules that consrain events located on
 	beats:
 	    - nil:  If this input is nil, the default beat length for a time signature 
 	            will be used (i.e. the time signature '(4 4) will have the beat length
 	            1/4, the time signature '(6 8) will have the beat length 1/8, etc.
 	    - [a fraction]: If this input is a fraction, it will be used as the beat
 	            length. For example, if the time signature is '(6 8), the fraction
 	            3/8 will give replace the default beat length 1/8. The subdivision of 
 	            beats (the tuplets input) will relate to the alternative beat length.
 	    - [a list]:  If this input is a list, it will define an arbitrary beat
 	            division of the measure. For example, if the time signature is
 	           '(9 8), the list '(3/8 2/8 2/8 2/8) will distribute the beats

<backjump?>     Backjumping speeds up backtracking by jumping 
directly to the variable that caused a failed ruletest instead of

The following variables sets what engine a failed rule prefers to
backtrack. If the prefered engine cannot be backtracked, the system
will make another choice based on lower priorities. Note that if
more than one rule fails, the choice will be based on the most
frequently proposed engine to backtrack. 

The default settings can be found by opening a new preference function.

is true, the weight (given in the <weight> input) is passed to the engine. 
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a 
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false 
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it 
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the 
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the 
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. 

Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the 
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending

                 excluding (i.e. skipping) rests.
 - include-rests: The heuristic rule will receive rhythm-pitch pairs 
                  including rests.
 - rhythm/pitch-segment: For heuristic rules with one input, this setting  
                          is identical to the rhythm/pitch setting. For 
                          heuristic rules with more than one input, the rule  
                          will receive consecutive pitch/rhythm pairs between 
                          rests. The heuristic rule does not check 
                          rhythm/pitch pairs that are divided by a rest. This
                          setting is good for heuristic rules that are only 
                          valid within a phrase.

                      Format '(duration timepoint pitch)
 - rhythm/pitch-list-ALL: The rule receives a list with all duration-pitch
                  pair up to the point where the rule is checked. Rests are 
                  included in the list. The rule should only have one input.

<rule> is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the 
function has to be either true or false. Each input will receive a list 
with information regarding a timepoint in the score. If the rule has
more than one input it will receive information for consecutive timepoints. 
If the input-mode2 is set to list, the rule can only have one input.
The exact information and format of the list depends on the selected input 
mode (see below).

<voice1> and <voice2> are the numbers for the voices (starting at 0) that 
the rule affects. 

<input-mode1> determines what format for the variables:
 - d1_offset: The rule will receive a list with a duration in voice 1 and 
              the offset to the event in voice 2 that exist at the onset 
              for the duration in voice 1. Rests and grace notes in voice 1 
              are ignored. Grace notes are ignored in voice 2, but rests are
              included. Format: '(duration offset), example: '(1/2 -1/8).
 - d1_offset_d2: Identical to d1_offset but also returns the duration (or 
              rest) in voice 2. Format: '(duration1 offset duration2), 
              example: '(1/2 -1/8 1/4).

<input-mode2>
 - norm: This setting is the normal behaviour of the function. An input receives
              the information for one time point. More than one input it 
              will receive information for consecutive timepoints.
 - list: The rule must have exactly one input. The input will receive a 
              list of all time points that are known when the rule is
              checked. If any of the break-at-rest settings are used, the
              rule will check each segment at a time.

<input-filter> determines what information the rule will receive:
 - at-durations-v1: The rule will receive informaton for all durations  
              (grace notes and rests excluded) in voice 1.
 - at-events-v1: The rule will receive informaton for all events  
              (grace notes excluded) in voice 1. Rests are included.
 - break-at-rest-v1: This will only differ from the above setting for
              rules with more than one input. The rule will not not
              check durations that are separated by a rest in voice 1.
              If the list setting is chosen above, the list will be
              segmented at rests in voice 1.
 - break-at-rest-v1-v2: The rule will not check points where voice 1 or
              voice 2 (or both) have a rest. If the rule has more than 
              one input, it will not check timepoints that are separated 
              by a rest in voice 1 or timepoints that have rests in voice 2.
              If the list setting is chosen above, the list will be
              segmented at rests in voice 1 or 2.


The latter 2 settings are useful for rules that are only valid within 
a phrase.


[Backtracking: By default this rule will trigger backtracking in the other
               engine than the engine that failed. If this is not possible, 
               it will trigger backtracking in its own engine.]

A word on efficiency:
The most efficient input mode is the d1_offset (if the input-filter is set
to at-durations-v1): the system is able to check this type of rule earlier than rules 
with other input modes. This is due to that it can consider the last endpoint
as a new onset, without knowing the duration for this new event.

Optional inputs:
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch 
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that 
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule 
is true, the weight (given in the <weight> input) is passed to the engine. 
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a 
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false 
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it 
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the 
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the 
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. 

Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the 
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending
on the candidate)."

<rule> is a logic statement in he form of a function. The output of the 
function has to be either true or false. Each input will receive a list 
with simultaneous pitches (optional with duration and offsets). If the 
rule has more than one input it will receive information for consecutive 
events (the positions of the events are determined by the input-mode 
setting).

<list-of-voices> is a list with the numbers of the voices (starting at 0) that 
the rule accesses. Any number of voices can be accessed by the rule. It is also 
possible to give a list of lists of voices: all sublists will generate a 
separate rule. All voices must have a pitch and rhythm domain. For efficiency 
reasons it is advised to rather split the rule into several simpler rules 
(that only access a few number of voices) if possible. This will make it 
possible to find failed candidates sooner, and to be more precise about what 
caused backtracking.

<timepoints>  This input is only considered if the input-mode is 
              at-timepoints. This is a list of absolute timepoints 
              (starting at 0) where the rue will be checked. 
              Ex. (0 5/4 9/4)

<input-mode> sets at what time points the rule will be checked. 
 - all:        The rule will be checked at every harmonic slice.
               Every time any voice has a new note event, the rule
               will be checked.
- beat:        The rule will be checked at metric beats.
- 1st-beat:    The rule will be checked at the first [down] beat
               in every measure.
- 1st-voice:   The rule will be checked at the onset of every new note 
               in the first voice in the list-of-voices.
- at-timepoints:  The rule will be checked at the timepoints in the 
               timepoints input.

<format> sets the format an input on the abstraction will receive. Note
that rests will be indicated as nil (without the specification of teh exact 
duration of the rest).
- pitch:       Each input receives a list with simultaneous pitches.
               Each pitch belongs to the corresponding voice indicated 
               in the <list-voices> input. Ex. '(67 60)
- p_d_offs:    Each input receives a list of lists. Each sublist represent 
               a corresponding voice indicated in the <list-voices> input.
               A sublist contains the information about an events pitch, 
               duration and offset between the events onset and the time
               point the rule was checked (this is determined by the
               <input-mode> setting). Offsets are either 0 or a negative 
               distance. Ex. '((67 1/4 0) (60 1/4 -1/8)).
- p_d_offs+timepoint: Each input receives a list of lists. Each sublist  
               represent a corresponding voice indicated in the <list-voices> 
               input. In addition, the time point for when the rule is 
               checked is added as a final value (note that this value 
               is not in a sublist). A sublist contains the information 
               about an events pitch, duration and offset between the 
               events onset and the time point the rule was checked (this 
               is determined by the <input-mode> setting). Offsets are 
               either 0 or a negative distance. 
               Ex. '((67 1/4 0) (60 1/4 -1/8) 5/4).

list-all-voices can include any number of voices. All voices must have a pitch 
and rhythm domain.

DO NOT use this rule to restrict rests in relation to other rests: use instead
the r-rhythm-rhythm.

Optional inputs:
By expanding the function it is possible to use the rule as a heuristic switch 
rule. A heuristic switch rule is still using a logic statement (that 
outputs true or false), but the effect of the rule is different: If the rule 
is true, the weight (given in the <weight> input) is passed to the engine. 
If it is false, a weight of 0 will be passed. A candidate that receive a 
high weight will have a higher priority for being picked when the true/false 
rules are checked. A heuristic rule can never fail a candidate, nor can it 
trigger backtracking of the engine. Heuristic rules only sort the 
candidates locally before the strict rules are applied. Depending on the 
context, heuristic rules might have more or less of an effect. 

Heuristic switch rules differs slightly form regular heuristic rules (the 
latter don't output true or false, but a weight that might vary depending
on the candidate).
